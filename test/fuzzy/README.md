# Fuzzy testing

This folder contains fuzzy tests to verify the Generic Multicast protocol validity, based on 
the [Hashicorp fuzzy test](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft/tree/master/fuzzy). The tests applied here will verify if 
the protocol ensures the reliability to keep working even when facing network failures.
